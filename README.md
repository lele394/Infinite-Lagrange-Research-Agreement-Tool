This tool is being developped by me, myself and I. 

This tool is here to help you with choosing phases options during the Research agreement.

All data and the idea of this tool is from [This Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ij5KR9YgrgBzRJ9jCc4f05MoJk0hqo4rjhMjZHo75bw/edit#gid=733054669), and all credit is due to the people behind it. I am but merely a guy that made an html interface.

to use please visit [lele394.github.io/Infinite-Lagrange-Research-Agreement-Tool/](https://lele394.github.io/Infinite-Lagrange-Research-Agreement-Tool/)

Planned features :
* ship options preview : done
* filters preview : input filters to see possible outcomes : done
* apply selected ship options to the filter preview : not a good idea as it could put more than 3 phases in the option selector, would rather have people inputting it manually
* makin it look dop' : always on it! (planned to add multiple color theme for fun lol)
* display numbers of ships of each categories : done
* display graphs for visual representation of percentages for each ship : planned
* save current selection in local cache/text format : planned

Feel free to contact me here in the issues tab.
