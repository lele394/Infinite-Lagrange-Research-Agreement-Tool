This tool is being developped by me, myself and I. 

This tool is here to help you with choosing phases options during the Research agreement.

All data and the idea of this tool is from [This Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ij5KR9YgrgBzRJ9jCc4f05MoJk0hqo4rjhMjZHo75bw/edit#gid=733054669), and all credit is due to the people behind it. I am but merely a guy that made an html interface.

to use please visit [lele394.github.io/Infinite-Lagrange-Research-Agreement-Tool/](https://lele394.github.io/Infinite-Lagrange-Research-Agreement-Tool/)
